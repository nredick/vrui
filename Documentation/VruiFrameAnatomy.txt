Anatomy of a Vrui frame
=======================

Vrui::vsyncWindow:
- Tags one window to drive Vrui kernel's frame prediction state
  - Frame interval
  - Next vsync time
  - Next exposure time
- Tells that window to track vsync state (and enable vsync)
  - Parameter to setVruiState method?
- Enables motion prediction / simulation time prediction in Vrui kernel

- Add mechanism so that an event can wake up the inner loop, but then
  tell it to go back to sleep without triggering a frame?

Vrui frame loop modes:
- vsyncWindow enabled, updateContinuously disabled:
  - Frame loop:
    - Wait for an event (includes Vrui::requestUpdate, Vrui::scheduleFrame, etc.)
    - Ask vsync window to update vsync prediction state based on how
      much time has passed
      - Or keep updating even while idle?
    - Poll and motion-predict input devices
    - Simulate application state to exposure time
    - Render all windows
    - Expose all windows, which will wait for vsync on any windows set
      up such, including the vsync window
      - vsync window will update Vrui kernel's vsync state

- vsyncWindow enabled, updateContinuously enabled:
  - Frame loop:
    - Poll and handle events
    - Ask vsync window to update vsync prediction state based on how
      much time has passed
    - Poll and motion-predict input devices
    - Simulate application state to exposure time
    - Render all windows
    - Expose all windows, which will wait for vsync on any windows set
      up such, including the vsync window
      - vsync window will update Vrui kernel's vsync state

Times and deadlines:
- Time by which the next frame must be done rendering and submitted to ensure continuity = start of new raster read-out
  - For "normal" windows, submission time is vsync
    - Vrui needs to keep track of which window is responsible for vsync
      - Clusters complicate things
    - Responsible window needs to track and predict vsync times
  - For HMD windows, submission time is vsync minus warping time
    - Either window itself or VR compositor tracks and predicts submission times
    - Client reads submission time from VR compositor's shared memory
  - Total length of a frame is time from submission to submission = frame rate
- Time by which the next frame will be presented to the user
  - Should be used for motion prediction and simulation
  - Comes either from vsync-responsible window or from VR compositor
